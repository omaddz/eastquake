# **eastQUAKE: Raising Awareness About Earthquake Vulnerability in Eastern Canada** 

Team: Angelina Abi Daoud, Olivia Maddigan, and Madinakhon Sulaymonova  

## **Mission Statement**  

When we think of earthquakes in Canada, most of us think of the high magnitude Earthquakes that happen on the West Coast, in British Columbia along the Cascadia Subduction Zone. However, approximately 450 earthquakes occur in eastern Canada each year, and the people living there don’t even know the extent of this risk.

Though many earthquakes have occured over time, only some are listed as being historic due to a variety of factors - magnitude, extent of impact from damage, number of casualties. Earthquakes are often measured using the Moment Magnitude scale, which measures the energy released by an earthquake, from 1 to 10. Each step in magnitude is approximately 30 times the amount of energy as the previous step. This means that an earthquake of magnitude 2.0 releases 30 times the energy as a magnitude 1, and a magnitude 3 earthquake releases 900 times the energy of a magnitude 1. However, magnitude alone doesn’t necessarily determine the destructive capabilities of an earthquake, which is often what we as people care about - the resilience of the communities we built, and the lives of those we love. 

The proximity of the earthquake to a population centre, how shallow in the Earth it occurs, and the secondary effects such as tsunamis, contamination of water supplies, gas leaks, power outages, landslides, and fires, are all factors that go into the devastation this natural disaster can bring. Although intraplate earthquakes are typically lower magnitudes, the risk in Eastern Canada has more to do with vulnerability. 

Intraplate earthquakes, also referred to as within-plate earthquakes, are triggered within plate interiors. The reactivation of old rifts is the main cause of this type of earthquake. In North America, factors such as glacio-isostatic adjustment, weakening of mantle from rifting or a rise of plume, gravitational body forces, large scale mantle convection, and dynamic topography can prompt an intraplate earthquake event to take place. This event can occur indirectly with plate boundaries. As rift-zone faults rupture from rocks within a particular seismic zone begin to become weak and fragmented, then tectonic forces apply stress on the plate boundaries that are being transmitted within the continent leading to earthquake events. 

Earthquake prone regions of Eastern Canada are divided based on clusters of earthquake activities: West Quebec, Charlevoix-Kamouraska, Lower St. Lawrence, Northern Appalachians, Laurentian Slope, Eastern Northern Ontario, and Southern Great Lakes. Considering the various zones that exist on the eastern side of Canada, our population is vulnerable to earthquake impacts due to our unpreparedness as a society. That is why it is important to consider disaster risk management as a way to enhance sustainable development within communities of Eastern Canada. This is a crucial pillar when looking for ways to develop a disaster-resilient society. Further advancing and supporting sustainable communities needs the hands of the general public, which is why being aware is crucial so they can prepare. Sustainability is an important aspect to consider for risk management as it ensures preventive measures against threats and earthquakes are set, with hopes that an effective preparedness plan and response can help the community.  

The primary purpose of eastQUAKE is to first and foremost raise awareness of earthquake vulnerability in eastern Canada. Seismic hazard maps compare the relative hazard of all of Canada, so eastern Canada will always seem low hazard compared to the West coast. However, we know from historical earthquakes that large magnitude and damaging earthquakes can happen, and will inevitably happen again. Team McDisaster has released two interactive web apps available within the eastQUAKE Story Map, each designed to increase earthquake awareness for Eastern Canadians: eastQUAKEs Near You and eastQUAKE Vulnerability. These applications are designed to communicate risk factors associated with vulnerability to earthquakes. 

Starting with the eastQUAKEs Near You, this web app allows Eastern Canadians to learn if they live within a certain distance from a past earthquake that was higher than 2.5 magnitude, in other words it helps with identifying earthquakes that have happened near their communities. On the other hand, eastQUAKE Vulnerability is designed to communicate risk factors associated with vulnerability to earthquakes. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was conducted to determine the top 10 most vulnerable areas in Hamilton, as well as rank the vulnerability of each Hamilton census tract. The MCDA used a pairwise comparison matrix to determine appropriate weights for each factor. There are countless factors that can contribute towards the damage caused by an earthquake. However, social, environmental, and physical factors had appeared most consistently in the relevant literature, and that we felt would provide a comprehensive MCDA for our local study site of focus - Hamilton, Ontario. 

Hamilton was used as we wanted to quantify earthquake risk so that Hamiltonians, and ultimately all eastern Canadians, can be prepared well ahead of anything that might happen. Earthquakes are unpredictable, and knowing that your region is earthquake-prone is the first step. Western Canadians are taught earthquake safety from a young age, and for good reason, but eastQUAKE wants every eastern Canadian located in a seismic hazard zone to know the exact course of action to take when one hits. That is why eastQUAKE to make sure you are aware, so you can prepare! 

## **App Description and Features**   
## **eastQUAKEs Near You Web App**

Helps Eastern Canadians identify earthquakes that have happened near their communities.

##### _Earthquakes Near Me?_   
Eastern Canadians are often unaware that they live in a seismically active zone where earthquakes have and will happen.
This feature allows users to define a buffer radius around any Eastern Canadian address (or your current location) to view which earthquake events have happened near you.
The user is prompted to enter their address, enable their current location, or drop a pin to locate earthquakes near them and display the time and date they happened, their magnitude, and a description of the place.
Default search radius is 50 km, user can scroll the bar to increase or decrease from 1 km to 100 km.
This tool is meant for Eastern Canadians to realize whether or not they live near an area where an earthquake has occurred. 

##### _Major Cities_    
This feature displays 10 major Eastern Canadian cities that, when clicked, automatically takes users to their chosen city.

##### _Filter by Magnitude_    
Users can filter the magnitudes of the earthquakes in order to view whatever range they would prefer to see between 2.5 and 7.2

##### _What's displayed on the map?_   
The Earthquakes layer displays all earthquakes that are greater than or equal to 2.5 magnitude that have occurred in Eastern Canada from 1600 to 2019.
The Major Eastern Canadian Cities layer displays a marker for 10 populous cities in Eastern Canada; at least 1 from each province.
The Population Density layer displays Eastern Canada's 2016 population divided by the census tract areas (km squared), from dark red (high population density) to white (low population density).

## **eastQUAKE Vulnerability Web App**

Designed to communicate risk factors associated with vulnerability to earthquakes. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was conducted to determine the top 10 most vulnerable areas in Hamilton, as well as rank the vulnerability of each Hamilton census tract. 

##### _Top 10 Earthquake-Vulnerable Zones_   
This feature helps the user pinpoint and navigate through the top 10 most earthquake-vulnerable zones in Hamilton identified through the MCDA.
The tool includes each Zone, from 1 to 10, clickable for the user with the corresponding zone's colour. The user will then be taken directly to the zone of their choosing, where they can then click on the zone and receive a summary of earthquake vulnerability of the area.

##### _Search Your Address_    
Residents of Hamilton can search their address in the search bar.
The user will be taken directly to their address, and can then view which level of vulnerability exists in their community, as well as find out if they live within one of the top 10 most vulnerable zones.
User can also allow the browser to use your location to automatically take you to your current location.

##### _Explore the Multi-Decision Criteria Factors_    
Users can explore the criteria that went into calculating the vulnerability of Hamilton to earthquakes.
In the Layers tool, users can turn layers on and off to compare these different social, environmental, and physical factors to the vulnerability value of their community.
This allows users to interact with the underlying data that went into the calculation, and see how these factors play into earthquake risk and safety.

##### _What's displayed on the map?_   
The top 10 most earthquake-vulnerable regions in Hamilton are shown in purple, with the darkest purple showing Rank 1 (Most vulnerable) and the lightest purple showing Rank 10 (Still vulnerable compared to other parts of Hamilton but the least out of the top 10)
The Vulnerability layer displays the calculated MCDA per census tract in Hamilton, taking into account the social, environmental, and physical factors discussed above. The dark rest depicts Hamilton's most vulnerable census tracts, with the lighter reds depicting less vulnerable zones.

## **Calculations**   

Calculations for the Hamilton Vulnerability Index were done following a typical Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) procedure using a Pairwise Comparison Matrix, with the Weighted Overlay Tool. All calculations were made using Microsoft Excel and the Field Calculator in ArcGIS Pro Version 2.8.6.   

The Index was calculated using 12 indicators that were weighted and combined to form the index. The data from which the 12 factors were derived are outlined in detail in Table 2 of the “Geospatial Open Data Sources” section. 

The Euclidian Distance Tool was used to determine distances from hospitals, fire stations, watercourses, and roads. 
The distances to hospitals and firestations matter because in an emergency, it is ideal to be close to emergency responders. Distance to watercourses matters and is worse the closer you are to the water because in an earthquake, streams can cause liquefaction of the soil which can be very damaging. Distance to roads is good because the closer you are to a road, the more opportunity and acess you have to escape.

The Feature to Raster Tool was used to convert the polygon data (population density, ages, lithology, soil type) into raster form. 
Higher population density is bad in the case of an earthquake because more people will be prone to injury in more cramped settings, especially apartment buildings where floors can collapse. Young people and Seniors are more likley to be victims of an earthquake because they are the most vulnerable populations. Lithology is important because types of rocks react differently to earthquakes, as with soil type.

To obtain building heights (taller buildings are more of a risk in earthqukes), the Digital Elevation Model was subtracted from the Digital Surface Model. 

##### _Part 1 - Indicator Standardization_   

The rasters were all put through the Reclassify tool to reclassify the data on a scale of 1 - 10, with 10 being the most susceptible to earthquake risk and 1 being the least. Equal Intervals were used for all datasets.   

##### Part 2 - Assigning weights and weight standardization   

Each indicator was assigned a weight reflective of its proportion to its influence using a Pairwise Comparison Matrix.

###### Table 1. Pairwise Comparison Matrix  
![alt text](https://github.com/oliviamadd/Equapolis/blob/main/img/t1.png?raw=true)

Factor 1 refers to neighbourhoods with high socioeconomic challenges, such as high unemployment and lower incomes. Factor 2 describes neighbourhoods with physical infrastructure challenges, such as low walkability and a low number of healthy food stores. Factor 3 refers to neighbourhoods with acute vulnerabilities, such as higher premature mortality and unnecessary hospitalizations. These factors correspond to the research done by Urban HEARTS@Toronto as common challenges faced by Toronto neighbourhoods, making these factors appropriate for calculating inequity.    

Because the Neighbourhood Equity Index is meant to identify differences between neighbourhoods, the factors explaining the most variance were weighted more heavily. Weights for the 15 indicators (listed in Table 1 above) were derived by the Social Policy Analysis and Research for the City of Toronto based on the Eigenvalues and community consultations [12].   

The composite weight for each indicator was calculated using the following formula, which was done in Microsoft Excel by Team McRaster:   

Indicator Weight =  (Factor Score1 * Eigenvalue1) + (Factor Score2 * Eigenvalue2) + (Factor Score3 * Eigenvalue3)   

#### Sample calculation of the Indicator Weight for Diabetes:   

Indicator Weight =  (0.826 * 5.378) + (0.323 * 3.147) + (0.218 * 2.559)   
				= 6.017   


Once the indicator weights were calculated, they were standardized so the sum of all weightings equal 1, using this formula:     

Standardized Indicator Weight = Indicator Weight / Sum of all Indicator Weights    


#### Sample calculation of the Standardized Indicator Weight for Diabetes:   
Standardized Indicator Weight = 6.017 / 51.213   
= 0.117   

###### Table 2. Final weights (in %) of all 15 indicators   
![alt text](https://github.com/oliviamadd/Equapolis/blob/main/img/t2.png?raw=true)

##### _Part 3 - Calculating the Neighbourhood Equity Index (NEI)_  

Weighted Neighbourhood Equity index was first calculated so that the resulting scores ranged from 0 to 1, where 1 is inequitable and 0 is equitable:  

Weighted Score = Sum of  (Standardized Indicator Value(i) * Standardized Indicator Weight(i))
Where i is one of the 15 indicators   

#### Sample calculation of the Weighted Score for Diabetes (Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills Neighbourhood):   

Weighted Score = 0.040404 * 0.117   
= 0.169223   


Finally, the scores were reversed and multiplied by 100 so that the final Neighbourhood equity Index would range from 0 to 100, with 0 being least equitable (worst outcomes) and 100 being most equitable (best outcomes):   

Neighbourhood Equity Index = (1- Weighted Score) * 100   

#### Sample calculation of the Neighbourhood Equity Index (Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills Neighbourhood):   

Neighbourhood Equity Index = (1- 0.169223) * 100
= 83.08   


Note: The equations were provided by the Social Policy Analysis and Research for the City of Toronto, but all calculations were re-done by Team McRaster in Microsoft Excel and the ArcGIS Pro Field Calculator to display the data spatially. The intention of Team McRaster is to display this data in an interactive and transparent manner, to reach the citizens of Toronto and key decision makers.
